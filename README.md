# Two4Tree
This was a project for my Data Structures and Algorithms class. The goal was to create a 2-3-4 tree data structure from scratch with capabilities such as insertion and removal of key-value pairs, as well as search and selection algorithms, and finding the rank, predecessor, and successor of an element.
